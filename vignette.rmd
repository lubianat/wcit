Let's try and find the indentity of the clusters below



```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)
data("pbmc_small")

pbmc_small@ident
TSNEPlot(pbmc_small, do.label = T)

```



First, let's detect the markers.

```{r}
markers <- Seurat::FindAllMarkers(pbmc_small)

```

So these are the markers for the different clusters. Let's run wcit and see if we can infer which type of cells they are most similar to. 

```{r}
library(wcit)
print("According to panglao db:")
for (i in levels(markers$cluster)){
  print(paste('For cluster', i, 'The most likely cell types are:'))
  print(wcit(markers$gene[markers$cluster == i]))
}
```
